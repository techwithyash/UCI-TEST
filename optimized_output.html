### Explanation of SEO Improvements

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the changes and why they are important for SEO:

#### 1. Descriptive `<title>`
*   **Before:** `<title>My Website</title>`
*   **After:** `<title>Healthy Eating Habits: A Guide to a Balanced Diet</title>`
*   **Why:** The title tag is one of the most crucial on-page SEO factors. The new title is descriptive, includes primary keywords ("Healthy Eating Habits", "Balanced Diet"), and clearly tells both users and search engines what the page is about.

#### 2. Meta Description & Keywords
*   **Before:** No meta tags were present.
*   **After:** Added a `meta name="description"` and `meta name="keywords"`.
*   **Why:**
    *   The **meta description** provides a compelling summary of the page's content. While not a direct ranking factor, it heavily influences the click-through rate (CTR) from search results, as it often appears as the snippet below your page title.
    *   The **meta keywords** tag is largely ignored by Google but is still used by some search engines and can be useful for internal site search systems. It helps to define the core topics of the page.

#### 3. Image `alt` Text
*   **Before:** No images were present.
*   **After:** Added an `<img>` tag with a descriptive `alt` attribute.
*   **Why:**
    *   The `alt` text (**"A colorful plate of healthy food including grilled chicken, fresh vegetables, and quinoa."**) is essential for both accessibility and SEO.
    *   **Accessibility:** It describes the image to visually impaired users who use screen readers.
    *   **SEO:** It provides context to search engines, helping them understand the image content and index it for Google Images search, driving more traffic.

#### 4. Open Graph & Twitter Card Tags
*   **Before:** No social media tags were present.
*   **After:** Added `og:` (Open Graph for Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) and `twitter:` (for Twitter) tags.
*   **Why:** These tags control how your content appears when shared on social media platforms. By specifying a title, description, and image, you ensure a rich, professional-looking preview that encourages more clicks and engagement. `summary_large_image` for Twitter creates a more visually appealing card.
    *   **Note:** I've used placeholder URLs (`https://www.your-website.com/...`). You should replace these with your actual domain and image paths.

#### 5. Preserved Existing Content
*   All original text content, the `<h1>` tag, and the overall HTML structure were kept intact to ensure the page's core message remains the same.
