# AI-Internship-UCI

This repository contains my submission for the AI Developer Intern Technical Assignment, which includes solutions for: (1) a Social Media Content Generator that converts a blog article into 5 platform-specific posts, (2) a Website/POC Generator Flow that builds a basic website scaffold from a one-line business idea, (3) an HTML SEO Optimizer that enhances uploaded HTML files for better search engine performance, and (4) a PDF Compliance Analyzer that checks uploaded PDFs for file format, font, margin, and content section rules, producing a validation report in JSON. The code is written in Python using libraries like `pdfminer.six`, `PyMuPDF`, and `pdfplumber`, with optional LLM integration. To run, clone the repo, install dependencies, execute the scripts for each part, and follow Git best practices by committing your changes and creating a Pull Request with a clear title and description.
